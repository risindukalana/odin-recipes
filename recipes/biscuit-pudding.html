    <p>Chocolate biscuit pudding, commonly abbreviated as CBP, is a Sri Lankan dessert. Chocolate biscuit pudding is
        made up of alternating layers of milk-dipped Marie biscuits and chocolate pudding or icing. These layers can be
        seen clearly when cutting through the dish, which should always be served cold.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200 gm/ 7 oz. Arrowroot/Marie biscuits</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons custard powder</li>
        <li>3 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cocoa</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon instant coffee</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoons chopped nuts</li>
        <li>1/4 cup boiling water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the custard powder and cocoa with a small amount of the milk to a smooth paste.</li>
        <li>Boil the rest of the milk with sugar for 3-5 minutes or until the sugar has dissolved and the milk thichens.
        </li>
        <li>Add the custard powder and cook stirring all the while till a thick creamy consistency is formed. Cool.</li>
        <li>Mix the coffee in boiling water. Have a serving bowl ready before proceeding to the next step.</li>
        <li>Dip a biscuit in hot coffee, shake out the excess water and arrange at the bottom of the bowl covering the
            entire surface. Continue until the entire surface has been covered, using smaller pieces if necessary. Pour
            half of the custard onto the biscuit layer, and sprinkle half the chopped nuts.</li>
        <li>Repeat the biscuit and custard layers. Carefully shake the bowl so that the custard layer gets evened out.
            Sprinkle all the nuts. Also crumble any biscuit left over and sprinkle this on the surface. Refrigerate
            until ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>
